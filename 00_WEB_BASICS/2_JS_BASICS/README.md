## Assignment 3 - JS Problems

1. Write a JavaScript program to find the area of a triangle where lengths of the three of its sides are 5, 6, 7.

2. Write a JavaScript program to convert temperatures to and from Celsius, Fahrenheit.

```javascript
 [ Formula : c/5 = (f-32)/9 [ where c = temperature in Celsius and f = temperature in Fahrenheit ]
Expected Output :
60°C is 140 °F
45°F is 7.222222222222222°C
```

3. Write a JavaScript program to find the largest of three given integers.

4. Write a JavaScript program to capitalize the first letter of each word of a given string.

5. Write a JavaScript program check if a given positive number is a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 7.

6. ** It is found by comparing two DNA strands and counting how many of the nucleotides are different from their equivalent in the other string.Find out the difference in 2 strings. How many chars are different ?

```javascript
GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT
CATCGTAATGACGGCCT
^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^
```

7. Determine if a sentence is a pangram. A pangram (Greek: παν γράμμα, pan gramma, "every letter") is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once. The best known English pangram is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." The alphabet used is ASCII, and case insensitive, from 'a' to 'z' inclusively.

8. Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter.

Examples of isograms:

```javascript
lumberjacks
background
downstream
```

The word isograms, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.

9. Convert a long phrase to its acronym.Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms). Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a long name like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).

10. ** Create a JSON data object for Facebook news feed, should have data for author name, author image, post content, list of likes,comments and share etc. Now you must be able to query these  :

      e. How many users are there who have both commented and liked 5th post. Also show list of those users.<br>
      f. Find out the person who has commented most on your feed. (In top 10 posts)<br>
