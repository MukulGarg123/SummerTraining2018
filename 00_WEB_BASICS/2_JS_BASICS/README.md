2. Determine if a sentence is a pangram. A pangram (Greek: παν γράμμα, pan gramma, "every letter") is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once. The best known English pangram is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." The alphabet used is ASCII, and case insensitive, from 'a' to 'z' inclusively.

3. Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter.

The word isograms, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.
