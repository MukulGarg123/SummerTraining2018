## Project Idea

* Basic Login Page/Register Page is to be created for each project.
* You have to make links clickable and navigation should be working.
* you will also have to make a header in which you can show user acoount and logout.
* Additionally, you can make user profile page and link it to header.

Note : All of the pages are given in zip archive. Remove un-necessary part of the code. Please don't mess with JS/CSS files imported in HEAD of HTML for now.
